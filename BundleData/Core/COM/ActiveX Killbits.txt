# ActiveX Killbit registry
# Killbit is a security feature in web browsers based on Microsoft's Trident engine (such as Internet Explorer) and other ActiveX containers that respect the killbit (such as Microsoft Office). A killbit instructs an ActiveX control container never to use a specific piece of ActiveX software, whether third-party or Microsoft, as identified by its class identifier (CLSID).
