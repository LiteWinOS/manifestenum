# COM+ is a distributed extension for COM which let you instantiate
# objects on any computer with which mutual trust can be established.

# Clumsy and dubiously engineered, it never hit off in popularity,
# but it's sometimes used as a remoting solution,
# and by this time some technologies rely on it.
