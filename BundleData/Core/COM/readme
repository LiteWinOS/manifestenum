COM, OLE and all their enhancement technologies.

COM and OLE were developed simultaneously (COM grew out of OLE 1.0) and there exists a lot of confusion as to what name refers to what functionality.
Rule of thumb:
- COM is the standards for interfaces, reference counting and marshalling
- DCOM is marshalling between computers
- COM+ is an extension over DCOM with some enterprise services
- OLE is object, control and application embedding
- OLE Automation is IDispatch, variant and scripting support
- ActiveX is control embedding in web pages
