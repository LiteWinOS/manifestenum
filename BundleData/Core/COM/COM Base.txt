# COM is a set of rules and supporting facilities for:
# - Laying out language-neutral interfaces in memory and calling their functions
# - Implementing these interfaces and declaring your support for them
# - Registering your implementations for the operating system to create on demand
# - Querying the OS to create an in-process or out-of-process implementations
# - Managing memory and tracking lifetime of objects

Microsoft-Windows-COM-Base*
Microsoft-Windows-COM-Surrogate*	# dllhost.exe, hosts out of process COM objects
Microsoft-Windows-OleMsg-MC*		# instrumentation for COM/DCOM events

# Note: OLE is a technology based on COM which was developed simultaneously and they are often referred to interchangeably, but they are not the same.
