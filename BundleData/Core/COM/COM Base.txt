# COM is a set of rules and supporting facilities for:
# - Laying out language-neutral interfaces in memory and calling their functions
# - Implementing these interfaces and declaring your support for them
# - Registering your implementations for the operating system to create on demand
# - Querying the OS to create an in-process or out-of-process implementations
# - Managing memory and tracking lifetime of objects

# OLE and ActiveX
# The terms are used interchangeably for a set of extensions to COM
# which were released together:
# 1. Interfaces and support proxies which let an object expose its functions to scripting languages.
# 2. A set of interfaces and contracts to embed one application into another to edit sub-document in-place.
