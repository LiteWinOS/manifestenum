# Glossary
#  RPD NDR = RPD Network Data Representation, RPC and DCOM marshalling engine

#  Endpoint: Network-specific address of a server process for remote procedure calls. The actual name of the endpoint depends on the protocol sequence being used.
#  Dynamic endpoint: Network specific–server address that is requested and assigned at run time.
#  Well-known endpoint: Endpoint that does not change. Well-known endpoint information is stored as part of the binding handle, or within the name service–database server entry.
#  Endpoint mapper: Part of the RPC subsystem (RPCSS) that allows the run-time library to dynamically assign and resolve endpoints.

#  Name service: Service that maps names to objects and stores the name/object pairs in a database. For example, the RPC name service maps a logical name to a binding handle so client applications can refer to that logical name, rather than a protocol sequence and network address.
#  Locator: Microsoft Windows name-service provider.
#  Name Service–Interface Daemon (nsid): Service that provides an interface between Microsoft Locator and the OSF-DCE Cell Directory Service (CDS) name service databases for RPC name-service functions.
#  Cell Directory Service (CDS): Name-service provider for the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment.
