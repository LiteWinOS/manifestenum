# System Event Notification Service (SENS)
# Monitors and dispatches a number of system events to subscribers.
# Required lately, as many system components depend on it, including supposedly service triggers and some user logon procedures (otherwise only administrators can login).

# Events monitored by SENS include:
# - TCP/IP network events, such as the status of a TCP/IP network connection or the quality of the connection.
# - User logon events.
# - Battery and AC power events.
