# Unified Background Process Manager [W7+]
# Provides a common trigger-based activation platform for UBPM-registered clients.

# Provides the same set of events to various facilities in the system. The same triggers are available to all clients, exposed in various ways via their APIs:
# - Service Control Manager [W7]
#     Exposes UBPM Triggers via SCM Triggers API.
#     W7: Links to UPBM.dll via scext.dll. If this DLL is missing, triggers will not function but the rest of service management should work. This is done to allow for minimal kernels.
# - Task Scheduler Service [W7]

# The core RPC server is implemented in services.exe. Clients use ubmp.dll to access it.

# UBPM gets triggers from:
# 1. Starts an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session and enables each registered provider GUID (you can see this in the MMC Performance Snap-in).
# 2. Provies a number of triggers directly.

# W10:
# Statically links against a number of BM event providers (brokers), each via it's own C API DLL + core (usually a service or a driver):
#   DesktopActivityBroker, TimeBroker, SystemEventsBroker, EventAggregation
# These event providers are also covered (more extensively) by BackgroundBrokers deployment, so we'll list them there for now.

[DesktopActivityBroker]
# Not a true BM broker, but a UBPM only event source (so far).
# Deployed only by UBPM.
