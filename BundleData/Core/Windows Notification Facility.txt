# Windows Notification Facility
# A kernel API for sending native system event notifications to subscribers. Entirely separate from other event subsystems.
# https://blog.quarkslab.com/playing-with-the-windows-notification-facility-wnf.html
# Windows 8+

# The facility itself is implemented as a set of Rtl* and Nt* functions in the kernel. This bundle only contains supporting packages.

# An event is identified by it's WNF State Name (QWORD), e.g.:
#   1395033ea3bc0875 (low-ending)
#   7518BCA321078541 (high-ending)
# State Names are undocumented, declared locally in each DLL that sends them. Their structure and how to extract them:
