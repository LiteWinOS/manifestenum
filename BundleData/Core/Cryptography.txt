# Cryptography and Certificate Services APIs and Tools

# Useful note:
# All Crypto API team packages seem to be in the form:
#  Microsoft-Windows-dllname-dll


# Crypto API - contains a ton of functions
# See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380252(v=vs.85).aspx
# A lot of functions are covered by advapi32.dll which hosts tons of other API,
# newer functions are hosted in their respective DLLs
Microsoft-Windows-crypt32-dll*		# Newer CryptoAPI functions
Microsoft-Windows-cryptui-dll*		# UI helpers
Microsoft-Windows-cryptnet-dll*		# Networking helpers
Microsoft-Windows-mssip32-dll*		# Forwards some CryptSIP* functions to crypt32.dll (backward compability)
Microsoft-Windows-mscat32-dll*		# Forwards some CryptCAT* functions to crypt32.dll (backward compability)
# Note: Advapi32 only hosts entry points, redirects implementations to cryptsp and bcrypt.
# Support DLLs
Microsoft-Windows-cryptdlg-dll*		# Common dialogs for certificate management
Microsoft-Windows-cryptsp-dll*		# Implements some functions for advapi32
Microsoft-Windows-cryptdll-dll*		# Network security component required for SSL/TLS functions

# Microsoft Trust Verification API
Microsoft-Windows-wintrust-dll*		# Displays the Certificates dialog box.

# CryptXML
# Provides an API for creating and representing digital signatures by using XML formatted data
Microsoft-Windows-cryptxml*

# Signing API
# Provides functions to sign and time stamp data, helper functions for makecert.
Microsoft-Windows-mssign32-dll*

# Certificate services backup and restore API
# Available not on all systems.
Microsoft-Windows-certadm-*		# TODO: Verify the assembly name is right


# Cryptographic Service
# Provides four management services:
# - Catalog Database Service, which confirms the signatures of Windows files and allows new programs to be installed
# - Protected Root Service, which adds and removes Trusted Root Certification Authority certificates from this computer
# - Automatic Root Certificate Update Service, which retrieves root certificates from Windows Update and enable scenarios such as SSL
# - Key Service, which helps enroll this computer for certificates
# The service itself is registered in SF-CAPI2 package
Microsoft-Windows-cryptsvc-dll*
Microsoft-Windows-SF-CAPI2*		# Registers the service, and not much more

# Crypto Shell Extension
Microsoft-Windows-cryptext-dll*		# Also in Explorer


# CNG API (Cryptography API: Next Generation)
# Aims to replace CryptoAPI
