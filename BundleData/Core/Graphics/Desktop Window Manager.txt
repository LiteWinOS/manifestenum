# W7+
# Contains uxinit.dll, which seems to be a satellite for uxtheme.dll.
# uxinit.dll exports several functions which are unnamed on Windows 7, but named on W8+:
#   ThemeUserLogoff, ThemeUserLogon, ThemeUserStartShell, ThemeUserTSReconnect, ThemeWatchForStart,
#   ThemesOnCreateSession, ThemesOnDisconnect, ThemesOnEarlyCreateSession, ThemesOnLogoff, ThemesOnLogon, ThemesOnReconnect, ThemesOnTerminateSession
# No one statically imports uxinit.dll, it's never mentioned in the registry.

# Windows 10 deployments related exclusively to DWM
