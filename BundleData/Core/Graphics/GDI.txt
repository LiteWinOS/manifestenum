# Graphics Device Interface
# A kernel-level facility which provides graphics primitives such as pens, palettes and fonts and handles drawing commands to draw lines, curves, flood-fill or print text via the graphics device driver.
# Used by upper levels of graphics stack to paint higher-level UI (windows and controls).

# Desktop Window Manager, when enabled, underlies GDI these days transforming it into a higher-level layer. In that case GDI renders each window onto a picture which is then composited via DWM.

# Direct2D is the intended successor, but most of the applications still use GDI.

# GDI+ is a class-based API extension for GDI providing more modern tools such as anti-aliasing, shading and affine transformations for rendering.
