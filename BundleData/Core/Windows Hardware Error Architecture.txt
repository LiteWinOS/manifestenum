# Implemented as a platform-specific hardware error driver (PSHED) + a number of plugins (also drivers) which handle specific hardware.
# A plugin registers on a number of PnP IDs and is loaded if the devices are present. It implements a special callback interface which is called by PSHED.

# Platform-specific hardware error driver. Absolutely required, HAL depends on this.
# Also filed in Kernel.
