Contains components which do not correspond to anything useful but instead are left over from the build process or group existing entries in various ways.

This includes:
- Update packages
- MUI packages
- Feature packages
- Assemblies which provided configuarion abilities at design time (now useless)

It's also okay to temporarily store here other kinds of packages related not to any particular feature, but to the state of the image as a whole:
- Branding assemblies
- Assemblies containing particular settings values for the image (if not related to any particular component such as core)
- Poorly structured assemblies (containing a bunch of unrelated modules)

These kinds of assemblies should eventually receive their own place to live, but for now it's better to store them here than in a truly inappropriate place.
