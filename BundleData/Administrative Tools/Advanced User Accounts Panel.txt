# Advanced User Accounts Panel / "Map Network Drivers/Network Places Wizard"
# Opens User accounts and passwords configuration window (what you get by control userpasswords2)

# Contains:
#   netplwiz.exe		== control userpasswords2
#   netplwiz.dll
#   control panel registration for the above

# WARNING:
#   netplwiz.DLL contains BOTH "Advanced User Accounts" AND "Map Network Drivers/Network Places Wizard".
#   netplwiz assembly also ships lusrmgr.msc which is a thin wrapper for Local Users and Groups MMC snap-in (installed elsewhere).
#   This is a mess.
