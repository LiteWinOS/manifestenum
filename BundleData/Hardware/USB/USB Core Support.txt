# Core USB Support

# USB device can function in two roles: as a host and as a client device.
# Glossary:
#   USB Host controller - the USB controller on the host
#   USB Function controller - the USB controller on the client device (controller mode when we are the client)

# UCSI defines a software protocol and a set of features for USB controllers.
# This includes the ability to switch USB from host to client mode.

# Microsoft provides the Connector Manager as well as the default USB role-switch, device-side and host-side drivers (generic and branded as below), but the manufacturers can write their own ones.

[USB Function]
# A USB function class driver implements the functionality of a specific interface on the USB device. Certain class drivers are included in Windows, such as MTP and IpOverUsb. Windows also provides a generic kernel-mode class driver, Generic USBFN (GenericUSBFn.sys).
