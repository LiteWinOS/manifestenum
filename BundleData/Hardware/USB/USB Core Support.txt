# Generic USB Function Class Driver
# A USB function class driver implements the functionality of a specific interface on the USB device. Certain class drivers are included in Windows, such as MTP and IpOverUsb. Windows also provides a generic kernel-mode class driver, Generic USBFN (GenericUSBFn.sys).

# USB Type-C Software Interface (UCSI) Support [W10]
# # https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt595923(v=vs.85).aspx

# UCSI defines a software protocol and a set of features for USB controllers.
# This includes the ability to switch USB from host to client mode.

# Microsoft provides the Connector Manager as well as the default USB role-switch, device-side and host-side drivers (generic and branded as below), but the manufacturers can write their own ones.
