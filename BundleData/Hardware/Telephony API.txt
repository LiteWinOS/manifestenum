# Telephony API (TAPI)
# Provides computer telephony integration and enables PCs running Microsoft Windows to use telephone services.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony_Application_Programming_Interface

# TAPI is used primarily to control either modems or, more recently, to control business telephone system (PBX) handsets.

# Several versions have been made available
#   1.0 is for Win3.x
#   2.x is a pure C API
#   3.x is a COM API
# 2.x and 3.x have a slightly different sets of functions and coexist (some even prefer 2.x).
