# Enhanced Storage provides an extensible platform for accessing additional functions made available by enhanced storage devices; above and beyond the primary function of data storage.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd430343(v=vs.85).aspx

# Enhanced Storage currently supports devices implementing the IEEE 1667 standard (http://www.ieee1667.com) which defines a mechanism of storage target authentication prior to data access. Even more useful is the fact that the standard also defines a generic mechanism by which any customized function implemented by the storage device can be discovered and accessed.

# Enhanced Storage provides Windows applications with methods to:
# * Discover and access additional functions available on an Enhanced Storage device.
# * Discover and invoke function-specific workflow called action for an Enhanced Storage device.
# * Authenticate access to an Enhanced Storage device that supports device authentication.

# Glossary:
#   Eh/EhStor = Enhanced Storage
#   ACT = Addressable Command Target / Addressable Contact Target
#   PDC = Portable Device Command
#   Silo = One group of actions or one resource on the portable device. Different Silos perform different functions. There's a discovery protocol to enumerate available silos and their capabilities.
#   TCG = Trusted Computing Group, the makers of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and other security-related standards.
#   WPD = Windows Portable Devices
