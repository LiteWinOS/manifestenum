# Microsoft iSCSI Initiator

# iSCSI is a protocol which transmits SCSI commands over IP networks to provide access to remotely installed storage devices as if they were attached to a local computer.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI

# iSCSI Initiator is a client-side implementation of the protocol.

# See also: Fibre Channel - another implementation of the same idea, but with its own lower level protocols instead of IP.
