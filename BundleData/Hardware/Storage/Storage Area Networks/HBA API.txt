# HBA API (sometimes FC-HBA API or SNIA Common HBA API) is a management API for Host Bus Adapters connecting computers to hard disks.
# Originally developed for Fibre Channel networks, it's apparently now used for any SNAs.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC-HBA_API

# Under Windows, Fibre Channel and SCSI adapter drivers must implement WMI interfaces for HBA in order to be certified as compatible.

# This is apparently support libraries for that.
