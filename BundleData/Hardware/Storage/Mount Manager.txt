# Mount Manager / Mountpoint Manager
# Assigns drive letters and kernel names for disk volumes and maintains the database of mount points that are defined for each volume.

# Each logical volume under Windows is originally made available by the Volume Manager under a path in a form:
#   \Device\HarddiskVolume[1,2,3,...]
# This assignment is non-permanent. Volumes might get assigned different numbers on the next boot (although they usually don't).

# Mount manager identifies volumes uniquely by their contents and stores permanent associations of volumes to:
#  * unique kernel namespace links
#  * drive letters
#  * directories on other volumes (mount points):
# It:
# - Makes known volumes accessible on boot.
# - Watches for the arrival of new volumes and assigns them unused drive letters.
# - Acceps commands from other applications to configure drive letter and mount point assignments.

#
# Unique links

# Each volume gets assigned an unique additional kernel name in the form:
#   \Global??\Volume{GUID}

#
# Drive letters

# MM keeps a list of associated drive letters under HKLM\System\MountedDevices and creates a symlink for each of them in the form:
#   \Global??\C:

#
# Mount points

# NTFS volumes support reparse points which are blocks of data associated with a directory. File system filters can intercept requests which hit a reparse point and adjust them accordingly.

# Mount points are reparse points that store a volume name as the reparse data.

# Additionally, Mount Manager stores a database of all mount points defined for each volume in its System Volume Information folder. This is used to preserve mount point consistency when moving the disk.
