# Basic VGA Driver / Standard VGA Compatible Display Driver / VGA Save

# This works differently on W8+ systems and before that. Components are also confusingly named so watch out for comments.


# Standard-VGA-based fallback driver
# Hosts the standard VGA compatible driver (vga.sys) which is used ONLY as a fallback device (VgaSave) in case of problems and in some versions of Safe Mode. 
# The display.inf component below is used as a normal driver for VGA-compatible devices.
# This is a non Plug and Play driver.

# W8+: Replaced by Basic Display and Basic Renderer drivers.


# BasicDisplay and BasicRenderer drivers
# Since W8/WDDM1.2 rendering is now possible for display-only and render-only, and so the basic drivers are split too.
# This is still a non Plug and Play driver, but it's used BOTH as a fallback and as a normal driver for any VGA-compatible adapters. But not by itself. The display.inf component below registers it for Plug and Play.

# Standard VGA / Standard Display Driver
# In all versions of Windows, provides Plug and Play drivers for standard VGA compatible adapter. But:
# - on Windows < W8 contains a COPY of vga.sys from StandardVGA called vgapnp.sys.
# - on W8+ only associates the basicdisplay driver with compatible adapters.
