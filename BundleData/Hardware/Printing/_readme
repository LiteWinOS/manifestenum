== Print Providers
Provide printer objects with job control and management capabilities. Hide away all the details of printer functionality.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/introduction-to-print-providers

Print providers are registered in
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\

Third-party print providers were supported but are deprecated and discouraged since W10.

One default print provider is Local Print Provider which also handles TCP/IP and other connections.

The important point with Print Providers is that a Print Provider manages the printing queue. TCP/IP printer available from Local Print Provider will have local print queue, while with LanMan Print Provider the same printer can be managed by the server it's connected to.



== Monitors
Local Print Provider can connect to printers via a number of ports, provided by Port Monitors.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/writing-a-print-monitor

Typical examples:
  Local printing port
  USB port
  TCP/IP port

Port monitors are registered in:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\

Third-party port monitors are supported. Print providers other than Local Print Provider do not use Port Monitors.
