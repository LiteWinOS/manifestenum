# DeviceStage is a facility for manufacturers to provide custom device pages and icons for Devices and Printers folder.
# This allows them to present their device in a corporate branding.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/print/what-is-device-stage-

# DeviceStage allows the developer to provide a "Device Metadata Package" which is a set of XML and graphics which defines how the device will look in Devices and Printers folder.
# These are uploaded to Microsoft, verified, signed and automatically distributed to all PCs with compatible devices.
# Double-clicking on the device in the Devices and Printers folder will open it's updated DeviceStage page.

# To provide additional functions to the UI and to Function Discovery the developers still need to provide a Devices and Printers' DDO object.

# Installs "DeviceStage shell extensions" (dxp.dll) which annoyingly reactivate itself
# But if you want Devices and Printers to function then I guess you need it.

# Requires: Control Panel\Devices and Printers folder
