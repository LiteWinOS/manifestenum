# User-Mode Bus (UMB) driver and User-mode Passthrough
# Enumerates various devices implemented by user-mode drivers. User-mode passthrough (umpass.sys) is used in place of a kernel driver when installing such user-mode drivers.
# Probably related to User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF).

# Required and related for a lot of things, including:
#   IPBusEnum, UmRdpService, WPDBusEnum, spooler, rapimgr, wcescomm, TermService
# As well as many inbox drivers.
