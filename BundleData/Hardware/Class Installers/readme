Contains class installers/co-installers and property page providers.

* Class installers and co-installers are functions which run on the installation of a device of a particular reported class.
* Property pages are available via API for each device according to its type, and can be seen for example in Device Manager's device Properties.

Class installers and property pages are usually provided together.

Classes have to be registered in the OS. This is done in the registry, but the assemblies declare this with <deviceClass> XML element. Often the declaration lies in a separate assembly.

Not to be confused with class drivers, which are general purpose drivers which can handle a broad variety of similar devices.

Requirements:
Many standard installers rely on resources from SetupAPI, sometimes from imageres.dll. Some non-standard installers rely on the presence of their particular component, which may provide the installer code.
