# Universal Plug and Play / SSDP
# A set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence and supported functions.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play

# There are two APIs for working with UPnP-certified devices:
# - The Control Point API, which consists of a set of COM interfaces used to find and control devices.
# - The Device Host API, which consists of a set of COM interfaces used to implement devices that are hosted by a computer.

# Function Discovery uses UPnP as one of its sources of information.

# Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
# A network protocol for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information.
# It was incorporated into the UPnP protocol stack, and a description of the final implementation is included in UPnP standards documents.

# Plug and Play Extensions (PnP-X) enable a computer system to discover networked devices and to install them on the local system using Plug and Play (PnP).

# Works on top of UPnP, apparently.
