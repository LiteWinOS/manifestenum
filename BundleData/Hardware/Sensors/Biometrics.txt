# Windows Biometric Framework
# An API for retrieving samples of biometric information that can be used to uniquely identify the user, from any devices that support providing such an information.

# B. measurements are physical traits which are unique to each person, including:
# - Fingerprints
# - Iris patterns
# - Faces
# - Gait
# - Typing rythm

# Samples of biometric information are retrieved from sensors devices and stored associated with each user.

# B. Framework includes:
# - Driver Interface (WBDI)
# - Service which manages WBDI-compatible devices (Biometrics Service)
#  - Each type of biometrics requires a Biometrics Service Provider (WBSP), but these are built into Biometrics Service and are not plugins.
# - API library to access the above.
# - Credential provider
# - OS integration (Control panel, administrative tools)

# Can be used to login into the operating system via Windows Hello.
