# Sync Center
# Enables users to synchronize their data with other computers and devices from one place.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369140(v=vs.85).aspx

# Provides interfaces for developers to add custom facilities to be synchronized.
# This is different from adding your Windows Sync (DeviceSync) or MSF provider. In this case,
# you're only plugging into the UI and your handler can synchronize the data however you like.

# Introduced in Vista.

# Provides UI for: Briefcase, Offline Files.
# Both work on their own, and Offline Files UI is self-contained (cscui.dll).
