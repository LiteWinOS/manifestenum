# One-off commands / Generic Commands
# Updates and releases sometimes contain one-off commands, also called Generic Commands (GC), which execute some task once at installation and then never influence the OS again.

# When possible, these should be classified with the component that required them, but by default we put them here.


Microsoft-Windows-CleanupWindowsDefenderTasks*	# Seems to be a one-off job package

# The whole Microsoft-Windows-GC-* family of components are Generic Commands (GC), probably packages generated with some internal tool to produce such one-off tasks.
# But we include them on a case by case basis to watch out for possible changes to this rule.
