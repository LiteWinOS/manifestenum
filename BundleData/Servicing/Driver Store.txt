# Driver Store
# Starting with Windows Vista, the driver store is a trusted collection of inbox and third-party driver packages. The operating system maintains this collection in a secure location on the local hard disk. Only the driver packages in the driver store can be installed for a device.
# When a driver package is copied to the driver store, all of its files are copied. This includes the INF file and all files that are referenced by the INF file.
