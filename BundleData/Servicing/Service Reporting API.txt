# Service Reporting API
# Not much is known about these components. Seems to be some kind of servicing API. Contains functions such us:
# - OpenOsBaseline
# - EnumOsBaselineComponents
# - GetOsBaselineComponentInfo
# - GetOsInstalledComponentInfo

# The DLL is used by the Applications and Features control panel applet, and the configuration ones write OS version information to the registry.

# I suppose this might be relevant to getting the version of the OS and the service packs and the installed updates. Who knows.
# Related to Windows Setup.
# Observed on W7.

# API itself
