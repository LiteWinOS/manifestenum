# Migration Architecture / Migration Wizard / MigWiz / Windows Easy Transfer
# Contains components to aid in migration from the previous versions of Windows.

# Most components are standardized and consist of three parts:
# 1. A deployment
# 2. A -DownlevelManifest with a copy of the manifest to be replaced
# 3. A -ReplacementManifest with a new version of the manifest.

# Migration components are grouped into deployments similarly to how normal components are grouped in this version of Windows.
