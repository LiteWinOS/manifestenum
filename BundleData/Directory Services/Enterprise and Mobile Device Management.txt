# EnterpriseMgmt / Mobile Device Management
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/index

# There are two parts to the Windows 10 management component:
# * The enrollment client, which enrolls and configures the device to communicate with the enterprise management server.
# * The management client, which periodically synchronizes with the management server to check for updates and apply the latest policies set by IT.

# MDM has its own plugins called Configuration Service Providers (CSPs):
# "A configuration service provider (CSP) is an interface to read, set, modify, or delete configuration settings on the device. These settings map to registry keys or files."
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference
# As usual, only the core CSPs should be listed here, and the rest with their respective components.
