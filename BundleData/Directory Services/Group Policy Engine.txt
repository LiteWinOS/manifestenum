# Group Policy Engine
# Applies policy settings to computers and users in an Active Directory domain to enable IT administrators to automate their management.

Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-Base*

# Group Policies are collections of setting values enforced by domain administrators.
# Each Policy may be configured to apply to all or to some computers or domain users, and may modify any chosen set out of all supported parameters.
# All appropriate Policies are applied, as determined both by the computer and the currently logged in user.

# Policies are stored on the SYSVOL share of the domain controller, each in its folder by GUID.

# Group Policy application is handled by the Group Policy Engine which integrates into Winlogon and also runs a separate service.
# Policies are applied at startup, at user logon and at the Group Policy refresh interval.
# The engine takes the policies from the SYSVOL share. Once the policies are brought down to the client, the individual client-side extensions (CSE) apply the policies to the appropriate areas.

# Client-side extensions are DLLs which apply the policies to the appropriate areas of the local PC.
# They are registered with Winlogon in the registry key:
#   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions

# Standard CSEs will be listed as separate sibling components, while application specific CSEs shall be listed with the application.


# Policies are configured by domain administrator, usually with the help of Group Policy Editor MMC Snap-In.

# GPE in turn supports its own plugins which provide settings for specific areas. So for every setting that some CSE knows how to apply to the PC, there must be a GPE plugin which knows how to configure it.

# One GPE plugin in particular, "Administrative templates", supports further customization via ADMX files.
# These are XMLs listing available registry settings with descriptions. Both Microsoft and third party vendors may provide such files.

# Neither ADMX files nor GPE plugins have anything to do with applying the Group Policies, only editing.

# For more on GPE and its snap-ins see the appropriate package.

# GPE, it's children snap-ins and ADMX files all shall be listed in Administrative Tools or with their host applications (preferrable).
