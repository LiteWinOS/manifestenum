# Combined Windows Runtime Metadata package
# Contains metadata files for all major Windows Runtime API libraries.

# WinRT will not work properly without metadata, so you should probably keep this component if you keep even one of the assemblies.
# I don't know why MS hasn't grouped each metadata file with the appropriate library *sigh*.
