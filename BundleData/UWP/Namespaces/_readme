Windows RT apps have their own set of APIs in DLLs named like
  Windows.Entry.Entry
Most have their own assembly (as they should), but unlike .NET it's not dots but dashes there:
  Windows-Entry-Entry
Most are listed in the docs:
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211377.aspx


Rules for inclusion:
1. All API is by default included.
2. API is by default grouped by first term after "Windows."
3. Subsets of APIs clearly grouped together are to be grouped.
4. WinRT APIs that are not part of the default API set, but are rather only an API to some other component, are to be kept with that component.
