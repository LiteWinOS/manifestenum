# Windows.Globalization.dll is sometimes shipped as jsIntl.dll on W7, separately from UWP libs.
# It definitely covers the same set of APIs as it registers interfaces with similar set of names, and its internal name is set to "Windows.Globalization.dll"
# Perhaps some components which got backported into W7 rely on it.
# For one, Chakra (Edge's Javascript engine) explicitly tries to load it instead of Windows.Globalization when on W7, so maybe this is why it's called *js*Intl. But Edge's not even in W7 by default.
