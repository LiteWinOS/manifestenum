# Single-Instance Store / Storage (SIS)
# An NTFS filter driver that replaces duplicate files with copy-on-write links (referred to as SIS links) that point to a single backing file, reducing the disk and cache overhead of those files.

# Every SIS-enabled volume is backed by a Common Store which contains the original instances of all found duplicate files. Each instance elsewhere in the file system is made a symlink to it.
# Once a file is put into a common store under unique ID, it will never change; if it changes on disk, it's copied.

# Backup applications are requested to cooperate with SIS by identifying SIS-deduplicated files and handling them efficiently.

# Consists of:
# - a filter driver which implements the symlink/reference counting
# - a groveler which scans for duplicates and passes them to SIS for processing
# - an API

# Available on server versions of the OS (except for API).

# API DLL. Provides well documented C API.
