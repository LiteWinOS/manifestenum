# Windows Diagnostics Infrastructure (WDI)
# Windows components implement triggers that cause WDI to launch scenario-specific troubleshooting modules to detect the occurence of problems.
# Event-based and on-demand diagnosis is available.

# Needed for:
#   Disk Diagnostics / SMART (passes SMART warnings to WDI)
#   Network Diagnostics and Troubleshooting (implemented on WDI)
#   Resource Exhaustion Prevention
#   Memory Diagnostics
#   Windows Error Reporting (can recommend WDI to run certain scenarios)
#   Startup Repair Tool
#   Windows Performance Diagnostics
#   Program Compatibility Assistant (run on WDI triggers for known failures)

# Related to Windows Troubleshooting Platform which is a collection of Powershell troubleshooters at System32\Diagnostics.
# WTP troubleshooters can be invoked automatically on detection of a trouble case by WDI.

# WDI also has its own native plugins which register as diagnostics modules, event sources and native troubleshooters.

# Services: DPS, WdiServiceHost, WdiSystemHost
