# Windows Troubleshooting Platform / Scripted Diagnostics
# A framework with troubleshooters in System32\Diagnostics, which can run each at the request from the user and collect the results.
# Third parties can add their own troubleshooters written in PowerShell.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd323778(VS.85).aspx

# Troubleshooters from here can be run either manually (via Support Diagnostic Tool / MSDT) or registered as solutions to some problems via WDI, but most don't bother.

# Troubleshooters can be installed to System32\Diagnostics or shipped as standalone packages with filetypes DIAGCAB and DIAGPKG.
# Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (msdt.exe) is used to install/invoke such packages and to invoke any installed troubleshooters.

Microsoft-Windows-ScriptedDiagnostics*	# The framework for using PowerShell scripts as handlers for WDI events/scenarios.
Microsoft.Windows.Diagnosis*		# A set of .NET classes for scripted diagnostics to use
