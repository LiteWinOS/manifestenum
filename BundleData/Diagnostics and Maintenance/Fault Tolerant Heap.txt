# Fault Tolerant Heap
# A subsystem of Windows 7 responsible for monitoring application crashes and autonomously applying mitigations to prevent future crashes on a per application basis. Functions automatically.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd744764(v=vs.85).aspx

# Monitors application crashes via Windows Error Reporting. If a certain app is noticed often crashing due to heap-related errors, applies a compatibility shim which replaces Heap* functions with extra safe versions which leave additional space between allocations, delays block disposal after freeing, ignores non-fatal errors.
# Requires: Windows Security Center, WDI, Windows Error Reporting, Shim Engine.
# Ref.: Windows Internals, "Memory Management".
