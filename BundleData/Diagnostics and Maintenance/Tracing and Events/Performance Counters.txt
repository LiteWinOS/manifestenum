# Performance Logs and Alerts (PLA)
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa372635(v=vs.85).aspx

# Provides the ability to capture and log:
# - Performance counter values
# - Alerts when a counter crosses a threshold
# - System configuration changes for some settings
# - Calls to most functions of Kernel32.dll, Advapi32.dll, Gdi32.dll, and User32.dll
# - Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events

# Closely tied with ETW as most of ETW tracing is done through PLA.
# Inseparable on a package level from base PCI.
