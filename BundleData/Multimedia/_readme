========================
Windows includes a number of technologies which all implement pipelines and filters for audio/video processing:
- DirectShow (originally ActiveMovie)
- DirectX Media Objects
- Media Foundation

Filters for all of these are inter-usable through various native "wrapper" filters. Many explicitly support multiple frameworks natively and register as such.

There's also:
- Audio Compression Framework with its own codecs (compressors/decompressors) in .acm format.
- Multimedia Extensions (MME), the first universal and standardized Windows audio API.
- Video for Windows, which is an old set of APIs for playing video.

Since most of the codecs are universal, here we group them by codec, not by technology. When in doubt, do not group at all: create several components for several versions of the codec.
