# Kernel Streaming / Direct Kernel streaming (Direct KS) / WDM Audio driver model
# Kernel-mode processing of streamed data. Allows a device driver to create DirectShow-like filters and pins in kernel mode, providing access to hardware, lower latency communication and still be used within a DirectShow filter graph.

# W98+.
# Slowly being phased out since Vista.

# Microsoft provides three multimedia class driver models: port class, stream class, and AVStream. The vendor writes a minidriver that runs under one of these three class driver models.
# These are implemented as export drivers (kernel-mode DLLs) in the system files portcls.sys, stream.sys, and ks.sys. In Windows XP and later, ks.sys is referred to as AVStream.

# "WDM Audio Drivers" refers roughly to a driver built on kernel streaming:
# > A Microsoft Windows Driver Model (WDM) audio driver... [exposes supported KS stream types, properties, streaming support].
