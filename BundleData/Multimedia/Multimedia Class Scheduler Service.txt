# Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS)
# Allows multimedia applications to get prioritized access to CPU for time-sensitive processing (such as multimedia applications) as well as prioritized disc access to ensure that the process is not starved of data.

# Vista+

# A thread must invoke MMCSS API explicitly to use its services. The service itself monitors the CPU load and dynamically adjusts prioritie.
# When the service is disabled, processes don't get the priority boost but otherwise work as usual.
