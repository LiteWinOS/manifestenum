# DirectMusic
# A deprecated component of the DirectX. Allows music and sound effects to be composed and played. Architecturally, DirectMusic is a high-level set of objects, built on top of DirectSound, that allow you to play sound and music without needing to get as low-level as DirectSound.
# DirectSound allows for the capture and playback of digital sound samples, whereas DirectMusic works with message-based musical data. Music can be synthesized either in hardware, in the Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, or in a custom synthesizer.
