Contains encoders, decoders and processing filters used in audio/video pipelines.

Windows has several frameworks for audio/video pipelining:
- DirectShow
- DirectX Media Objects
- Media Foundation
As well as older ones such as ACM.

But most modern codecs can be used in all of them (either directly because they support several interfaces, or via native wrappers).
Hence filters are listed independently of the applicable framework, based only on their type.

See descriptions of the corresponding technologies for the details on each of audio/video pipeline frameworks.

See here for a reference of MF codec objects:

Reference:
  DSP = Digital Signal processor
  DMO = DirectX Media Object
  ACM is the ancient Windows "Audio Codec Manager", and most applications that can save audio files to WAV do so through ACM.
