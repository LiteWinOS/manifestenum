# Network Provisioning Client
# A COM API for downloading and parsing XML files which contain the list of available networks and information needed to connect to them.
# XPSP2+

# This was a service in XP called xmlprov, as an out-of-process COM server in xmlprov.dll.
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa940075(v=winembedded.5).aspx
# Back then it required MSXML and BITS. It was supposedly needed for Wireless Zero Configuration.

# This is an API DLL xmlprovi.dll. Perhaps the service itself got cut and only the API is kept for Wireless Zero Configuration needs?
