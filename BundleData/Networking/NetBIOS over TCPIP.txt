# NetBIOS is an old LAN protocol which among other things supported resolving textual computer names into addresses (DNS is used for the same purpose worldwide).
# Originally NetBIOS worked as a standalone protocol but these days it's usually implemented over TCP/IP:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS_over_TCP/IP
# This service runs NetBIOS over TCP/IP and provides its functions to the system.
# NetBIOS local name resolution is particularly important. If lmhosts is disabled, accessing LAN computers by their names will be unavailable.

# NetBT = NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
# In Windows, there's seemingly a distinction between NetBIOS (user-mode API) and NetBT (low-level transport driver).
