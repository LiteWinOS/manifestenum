# NetBIOS is an old LAN protocol which among other things supported resolving textual computer names into addresses (DNS is used for the same purpose worldwide).
# Originally NetBIOS worked as a standalone protocol but these days it's usually implemented over TCP/IP:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS_over_TCP/IP
# This service runs NetBIOS over TCP/IP and provides its functions to the system.
# NetBIOS local name resolution is particularly important. If lmhosts is disabled, accessing LAN computers by their names will be unavailable.

# NetBT = NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
# In Windows, there's seemingly a distinction between NetBIOS (user-mode API) and NetBT (low-level transport driver).

# WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)
# Provides name resolution for NetBT by implementing a NetBIOS name server.

# Functions similarly to DNS. There can be one WINS server and any number of WINS clients. Clients register with the server and query it to resolve names to IPs.
# Independent from Lanman's Computer Browser. CB can resolve names in the local subnet, WINS can bring together results from CBs cross subnets. Most client PCs these days don't use WINS.

# WINS client is implemented in NetBT, this is an undocumented API library.
