# Network List Service / netprofm
# "Identifies the networks to which the computer has connected, collects and stores properties for these networks, and notifies applications when these properties change."

# *Maybe* stores the list of logical networks (as opposed to network adapters) this computer can or has connected to.
# Or maybe just an interface for enumerating them.

# Exports a large and well commented type library with interfaces to:
# - enumerate networks and network connections, read their names, descriptions, domain type, state (and whether connected to the internet) as well as the aggregated connectivity state of the machine
# - subscribe to network additions, deletions, connectivity changes and property changes.
# From the looks of it, the functionality is similar to what the networks panel in the system tray provides.

# Sources say:
# "This service in conjunction with Network Location Awareness and Network Connections enables status of network connections in the system tray."
