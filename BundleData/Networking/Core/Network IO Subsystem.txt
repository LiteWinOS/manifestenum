# Network I/O subsystem
# "The component provides dynamic binding support and configurable information management for networking components"

# Exports a ton of kernel APIs related to networking. This includes the ones below as well as a lot of non-prefixed functions.

Microsoft-Windows-netio-infrastructure*


# Network Store Interface:
#   Nsi*		Reexported to user-mode by NsiSvc.
# Stores and retrieves persistent configuration and run-time information from providers such as TCP/IP.


# Network Module Registrar
#   Nmr*
# Attaches pairs of registered network modules that support compatible Network Programming Interfaces (NPIs). After they are attached, the network modules can interact with each other independent of the NMR.
# NPIs have to be registered and consist of of an ID, a set of provider functions and a set of client callback functions. (One example is Winsock Kernel)

# Winsock Kernel:
#   Wsk*		Winsock Kernel Registration Functions (see below)
# Only the registration functions are exported. The rest of the API is received from these functions as dispatch tables (and some from received functions in turn).

# Windows Filtering Platform:
#   Fe*
#   IoctlKfd*, Kfd*	Kernel Filtering Driver?
#   Wfp*		Windows Filtering Platform
# Allows applications to tie into the packet processing and filtering pipeline of the TCP/IP network stack.
# See Windows Filtering Platform component.


# Other function families:
#   Fsb*

#   Hf*		Handle Factory?
