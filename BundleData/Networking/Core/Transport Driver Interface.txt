# Transport Driver Interface (TDI)
# A common set of IOCTLs and routines to be exposed by kernel-level network transports and to be expected by user-mode clients, as well as a set of system glue.
# Underlies all user-mode network APIs such as Windows Sockets or NetBIOS. Overlies transport providers such as TCP/IP or NetBT.
