# Windows Filtering Platform
# Allows applications to tie into the packet processing and filtering pipeline of the TCP/IP network stack.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Filtering_Platform

# Required for and partially implements both Windows Firewall and IPSec (only user-mode and supporting components are implemented outside of it).

# Consists of:
# * shims, which expose packets structure for protocols at different layers
# * kernel filtering engine (drivers can plug into this to inspect and filter packets)
# * user-mode base filtering engine (BFE) which filters packets based on rules (== core for Windows Firewall)
# 

# Public kernel API is partially exported by netio.sys.

# User-mode support component:
# * Base Filtering Engine service
# * IKE (Internet Key Exchange, part of IPSec) Extensions service
# * Windows Filtering Platform user-mode API
# * Windows Filtering Platform NetSh helper
