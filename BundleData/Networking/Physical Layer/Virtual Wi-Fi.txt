# Virtual Wi-Fi
# Creates several virtual Wi-Fi adapters over a single Wi-Fi card, so that you can connect to multiple IEEE 802.11 networks at once.
# Underlies Wi-Fi access point internet sharing: one of the virtual adapters runs the access point while another connects to the internet.

# Originally a project from Microsoft Research. Included in Windows since at least Vista.

# Implements Virtual Wi-Fi Bus which other Virtual* things (Virtual Network Channel, Virtual WWAN) found convenient to use, so it's required for them.
