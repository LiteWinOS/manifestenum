Components that manage physical network layers:
  802.3 (Ethernet)
  802.11 (Wi-Fi / WLAN)
  Mobile Broadband / WWAN

Physical (#1) layer technologies lie above drivers and strictly below Network layer (#3). Data link layer (#2) is subdivided into lower Media Access Control layer which is included, and upper Logical Link Control, which is not.

The components here cover everything from the drivers to the UI.
