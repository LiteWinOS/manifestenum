# Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD)
# A proprietary link layer protocol for network topology discovery and quality of service diagnostics.

# Vista+

# Operates both over wired and wireless networks. Enables device discovery via the data-link layer (Layer 2) and determines the topology of a network. Provides QoS Extensions that enable stream prioritization

# Requires a responder on each PC which can be discovered. (E.g. XP devices won't be visible)

# Devices can report their name or function, icon, link to their web UI from their responders. Windows uses this in the Network Map. Windows itself has a kernel LLTD responder built-in since Vista.

# Required for the Network Map feature to display a map of LAN or WLAN.
# Required for QWave QoS for advanced functions.
