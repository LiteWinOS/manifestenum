# Distributed File System (DFS) is an extension for LanmanServer (Samba)
# which replicates the share between several servers and transparently merges these mirrors on the client.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_File_System_(Microsoft)

# Strictly speaking, the replication service and the client service are unrelated.
# Either may be used alone.

# This is not a filesystem, despite the name. It's only an extension for Samba.
