# HTTP Server Core
# A common kernel driver which receives HTTP requests and routes them to applications registered as HTTP servers, as well as an API to register as one.
# Routing is differentiated via HTTP address. Any number of applications can service HTTP requests independently if they all use this API.

# Standard OS component since W2013.
# IIS depends on this.
