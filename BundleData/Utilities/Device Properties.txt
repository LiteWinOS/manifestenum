# Device Properties
# Shows device properties window (the one that can be accessed from Device Manager).

# Undocumented utility app. Accepts 2 or 3 parameters in this order:
#   DeviceProperties.exe [HWND] <DeviceId>
# Where:
#   HWND is the window handle for the parent window (can be omitted)
#   DeviceId is the full ID of the device to show properties for (in the properties itself this is called "Device Instance Path", not "Device ID").
#   Example:
#     IDE\CDROMTSSTCORP_CDDVDW_SH-S223C________________SB05____\5&2CC8A95A&0&2.0.0

# Calls devmgr.dll's DevicePropertiesW(hWnd, NULL, DeviceID, 0) to show the property window.
