# Data Protection API (DPAPI) is a simple API to store personal user keys and encrypt arbitary application data.

# It's used by a wide range of higher level components, incl. EFS and Vautt.

# The API itself is implemented in Crypt32.dll, this is only a tool to migrate keys.

# Windows Vaults stored in the profile of a user are protected by the Windows Data Protection application programming interface (DPAPI). This protection depends on the Security ID (SID) of the user. The SID for the user is unique to the computer on which the user account is created. As a result, simply restoring a previously backed up Vault on a different computer is not sufficient. The DPAPI keys on the new computer also need to be updated so that they can decrypt the restored Vault.
