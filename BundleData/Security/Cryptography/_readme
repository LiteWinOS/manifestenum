Cryptography in Windows
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380255(v=vs.85).aspx

There's roughly two cryptography stacks in modern Windows:
* CAPI/CAPI2 (CryptoAPI): The oldest and most widely used one.
* CNG (Cryptography: Next generation): The newer one intended as a replacement.

Both are well documented, stable and reliable.

Common abbreviations:
CSP = Cryptographic Service Provider

There's a broad range of CSPs:

They are registered in the registry:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider
Most are implemented in one of the two libraries: rsaenh.dll or dssenh.dll. Other components can also provide their own ones (notably SmartCard Subsystem installs a key storage provider).

CryptoAPI team packages are often in the form:
  Microsoft-Windows-dllname-dll
There's often a separate assembly with registry data in a different namespace (e.g. Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-dllname-registration).
