# A lot of functions are covered by advapi32.dll which hosts tons of other API, newer functions are hosted in their respective DLLs
# Advapi32 mostly just hosts entry points, redirects implementations to cryptsp and bcrypt.

Microsoft-Windows-crypt32-dll*			# Exports the majority of CryptoAPI
Microsoft-Windows-mssip32-dll*			# Forwards some CryptSIP* functions to crypt32.dll (backward compability)

Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-instrumentation*	# crypt32 events

Microsoft-Windows-cryptui-dll*			# Provides UI for common crypto-related operations.

Microsoft-Windows-cryptnet-dll*			# Networking functions (e.g. CryptGetObjectUrl)
Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-cryptnet-reg*		# Registration for cryptnet.dll

Microsoft-Windows-cryptsp-dll*			# Implements some functions for advapi32
Microsoft-Windows-cryptdlg-dll*			# Common dialogs for certificate management

Microsoft-Windows-cryptdll-dll*			# Network security component required for SSL/TLS functions
Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-cryptdlg-reg*		# cryptdll.dll registration

Microsoft-Windows-CryptBase*		# "Implements low-level cryptographic APIs for memory encryption/decryption and session keys"

# Microsoft Trust Verification API
# Provides WinTrust* and CryptCAT* function families.
Microsoft-Windows-wintrust-dll*		# Displays the Certificates dialog box.
Microsoft-Windows-softpub-dll*		# Compatibility proxy. Forwards a few functions (which were probably originally declared here) to wintrust.dll, notably Softpub*.
Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-wintrust-reg*	# wintrust.dll registration
Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2-setreg*		# more wintrust.dll registration

# CryptXML
# Provides an API for creating and representing digital signatures by using XML formatted data

# Cryptographic Service
# Provides four management services:
# - Catalog Database Service, which confirms the signatures of Windows files and allows new programs to be installed
# - Protected Root Service, which adds and removes Trusted Root Certification Authority certificates from this computer
# - Automatic Root Certificate Update Service, which retrieves root certificates from Windows Update and enable scenarios such as SSL
# - Key Service, which helps enroll this computer for certificates
# The service itself is registered in SF-CAPI2 package
Microsoft-Windows-cryptsvc-dll*
Microsoft-Windows-SF-CAPI2*		# Registers the service, and not much more

# "Abstract Syntax Notation One implementation". Implements ASN.1. Produced by and used mostly by crypto APIs, so stored here for now.
Microsoft-Windows-msasn1*

# "GUI Application for adding, deleting and viewing credentials stored by credential manager"
# Yet is a DLL.
