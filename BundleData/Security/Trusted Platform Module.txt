# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
# TPM is a dedicated secure cryptoprocessor which stores and generates cryptographic keys and limits access to them.
# Each TPM chip has a unique and secret RSA key burned in as it is produced.

# It also includes capabilities such as:
#   Remote attestation – creates a hash key summary of the hardware and software configuration. This allows a third party to verify that the software has not been changed.
#   Binding – encrypts data using TPM bind key, a unique RSA key descended from a storage key.
#   Sealing – encrypts data and in addition specifies a state in which TPM must be, in order for the data to be decrypted.

# TPM Base Services (TBS)
# Centralizes TPM access across applications. Provides an API exposed through remote procedure calls (RPC) to cooperatively schedule TPM access. Runs as a system service.
