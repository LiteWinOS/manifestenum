# SetupAPI
# A powerful, old and widely used API for installing and enumerating installed devices.

Microsoft-Windows-SetupAPI*

Microsoft-Windows-SPInf*		# Implements INF file processing for SetupAPI. Delay-loaded by it. Provides a long list of neat undocumented SpInf* family functions.
Microsoft-Windows-spfileq*		# Implements Setup Queues for SetupAPI (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa377408(v=vs.85).aspx). Provides a list of undocumented SpFileQueue* functions.

# See also: Hardware\Class installers - for the components which handle actual installation/uninstallation and property pages for the devices, as well as for device class declarations.


# Inf Default Installer
# A simple wrapper which runs the default section install for a given INF file.
# Traditionally this was done by calling into setupapi.dll,InstallHinfSection, but on Vista+ we have this tool.

Microsoft-Windows-InfDefaultInstall*

# Grouped with SetupAPI because SetupAPI registers it as a handler for inf files at the moment anyway.
