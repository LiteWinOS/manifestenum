# DirectUser framework / DUser
# Seems to be a windowless controls framework originated from Explorer and borrowed by a few other places in the OS.

# Exports a lot of pretty-named API functions. From the examples in its resources, supports a HTML/CSS-like interface definition language.
# DUser windowless controls are called Gadgets.

# Used in a variety of apps across the system, although often superficially (usually just one or two functions)
# Major users:
# - Windows Update client in Windows 7
# - Explorer Frame DLL
# - And Internet Explorer where it seems to have originated.

# IE uses DUser heavily and includes its own copy of it, called IEUI.dll (with the same set of API functions).
# The reason is probably antitrust lawsuits: it is forbidden for in-house apps to use undisclosed OS APIs. DUser was specifically mentioned in some lawsuits. So they copied the OS-wide API into their own DLL which they ship with IE.
