# DirectUI
# A C++ user interface library created by Microsoft to be a WPF like API for native applications.
# Not released to the public but is being used very widely throughout Windows (tens of Vista/W7 applications), Office, and Live Messenger.
# https://github.com/jameskeane/directui

# Exports a lot of name mangled functions (C++ classes).
