# Schedule UI
# Not an API per se. Provides several variations of a dialog with a 24x7 time/day grid with different additional options.
# The user can check each cell to configure the state of something at that time.

# Exports:
#   ConnectionScheduleDialog
#   DialinHoursDialog
#   DirSyncScheduleDialog
#   LogonScheduleDialog  (Restrict user logon hours - hence the DLL name)
#   ReplicationScheduleDialog

# Probably required for all UI places where these are used. (Some of these can be googled)
