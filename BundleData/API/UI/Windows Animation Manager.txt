# Windows Animation Manager
# Introduced in Windows 7. Designed to simplify adding animations to the UI.
# Schedules and executes animations. Supplies a library of useful mathematical functions for specifying the behavior of a UI element over time.
# Does not perform the rendering; can be used with any graphics platform, including Direct2D, Direct3D, or GDI+.
