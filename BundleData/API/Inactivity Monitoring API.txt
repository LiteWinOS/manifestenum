# Inactivity Monitoring API / User Idle Detection
# A half-undocumented half-deprecated API to monitor the keyboard/mouse for user being inactive (idle).
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg547646(v=vs.85).aspx

# The library msidle.dll exports unnamed functions, several of which have known canonic names and defintions:
#   BeginIdleDetection		https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb432198(v=vs.85).aspx
#   EndIdleDetection
#   GetIdleMinutes

# Microsoft discourages from using this API.
