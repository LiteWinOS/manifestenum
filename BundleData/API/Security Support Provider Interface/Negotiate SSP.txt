# Microsoft Negotiate (Negotiate, SPNEGO) is a security support provider (SSP) that analyzes the request and picks the best actual SSP to handle it based on customer-configured security policy.
# Currently, the Negotiate security package selects between Kerberos and NTLM. Negotiate selects Kerberos when it can.

# These days Negotiate is located in LSA (lsasrv.dll)

# There's an enhancement called NegoEx / NegoExts since W7.
# It introduces another SPP which can be selected by Negotiate and which in turn selects other SSPs (incl. PKU2U).
