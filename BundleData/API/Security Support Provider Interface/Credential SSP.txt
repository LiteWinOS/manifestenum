# Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP) is a Security Support Provider that lets an application delegate the user's credentials from the client to the target server for remote authentication.
# CredSSP provides an encrypted Transport Layer Security Protocol channel. The client is authenticated over the encrypted channel by using the Negotiate protocol with either Microsoft Kerberos or Microsoft NTLM.
