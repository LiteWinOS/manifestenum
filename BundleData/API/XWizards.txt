# XWizard
# Some kind of a generic "setup/solution wizard" engine.

# Clients have to register their wizard pages and interface in the registry under
#   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\XWizards

# It seems that XWizards can be launched inside of any application that asks for it.

# Widely used in networking configuration UI, but also outside of it. The following components use XWizards:
# - WLAN config and UI
# - WWAN config and UI
# - Network Connections folder
# - Home Group Control Panel
# - View Available Networks Control Panel
# - Windows Portable Devices (WPD) Network Config Wizard
# - GetConnected Wizards (basic and RAS)
# Additionally:
# - Some Terminal Services configuration
# - Some WCN configuration

# The engine itself
