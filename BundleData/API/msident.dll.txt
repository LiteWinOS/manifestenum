# msident.dll
# A deprecated API which long ago provided enumeration of user accounts (here called identities), subscription to logon/logoff/user change events and the ability to query user to login / create new account.
# Deprecated since XP, replaced by modern-day APIs, probably not functioning but still shipped for compability.
# W7

# Contains such interfaces as: IEnumUserIdentity, IIdentityChangeNotify, handles messages such as WM_IDENTITY_CHANGED.
# See for example:
