# Application Experience / Program Compability Assistant

# Overall a good thing:
# 1. A shim engine which allows to hotpatch OS and change behavior of some functions for a particular application.
# 2. A database of application and what hotpatches to apply for each.
# 3. A service which monitors applications and applies shims from DB.
# 3. A configuration interface for that database.
